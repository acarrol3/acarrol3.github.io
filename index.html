    <p>Bookmania is a typeface developed by Graphic Designer <a href="www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/bookmania">Mark Simonson</a> in 2002, but is a descendant of the font families Bookman and Old Style ("1900-"). Several fonts, including Linotype, Ludlow, and ITC are all developments of Bookman, however Bookmania is the first to offer five different weights of this style type (<a href="typographica.org/typeface-reviews/bookmania/">Keller</a>). Bookman is famous for its wide [CORRECT WORD?] which makes it easy to read, even as a serif font. It’s wide range of swash characters make it easily usable in advertising and other various graphics. It is heavily connected to the advertising style of the 1960’s and 1970’s, particularly for musicians ("1900-").</p>
